# SQL Data Analytics Project

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of SQL scripts used to explore data and perform different types of analysis for reporting and insights.  
The analysis follows a structured analytical flow, moving from exploratory analysis to advanced analytics.

---

## Data Context
The analysis is performed on data warehouse tables, including:
- Sales fact data  
- Customer dimension data  
- Product and category dimension data  

---

## Types of Analysis Covered

The SQL scripts are organized around the following analytical themes:

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Database Exploration  
- Dimensions Exploration  
- Date Exploration  
- Measures Exploration (Key Metrics)  
- Magnitude Analysis  
- Ranking Analysis (Top N / Bottom N)  

### Advanced Analytics
- Change-over-Time Analysis  
- Cumulative Analysis  
- Performance Analysis  
- Part-to-Whole Analysis  
- Data Segmentation  
- Reporting Queries  

---

## SQL Concepts Used
- Aggregations and grouping  
- Joins between fact and dimension tables  
- Window functions (`ROW_NUMBER`, `LAG`, `SUM OVER`, `AVG OVER`)  
- Date and time-based functions  
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)  
- Conditional logic for classification and segmentation  

---

## Purpose
This project demonstrates practical SQL analytics skills and shows how SQL can be used to explore data, identify patterns, and generate insights for business reporting and decision-making.
